[![Brunel-website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tryit-(here)-blue.svg)](https://brunelthence.netlify.app)

The website serves as a platform to market staff augmentation services to various companies, with a primary focus on targeting unicorns. The key emphasis lies in presenting a high-quality user experience, both in terms of aesthetics and functionality.

Key features of the website include:

- Users can click on the 'Get Projects' button to navigate to the register page with a registration form.
- Clicking on the close ‘X’ button or the company logo in the register page will redirect the user back to the homepage.
- The button is disabled until the user has entered information in both the input fields in the registration form.
- If the email input field doesn’t contain a valid email address (xyz@abc.com), then an error message is shown when the user submits the registration form.
- On successful submission of the form, the success screen is shown, which automatically redirects the user to the homepage in 5 seconds.
